Verification of Time Source Logic
=================================

Date: 2026-02-07
Package ID: 70edd3ce-d04e-4d68-8c90-2447e01629dc
Target Date: 2026-02-09

Test Scenario:
1. Package Option Template Time: ["12:00", "10:00"]
2. Database Trip Time (Modified): "11:00" (Original was 10:00)
3. Expected Result: UI shows "11:00" only (ignoring "10:00" from template)

Observation:
The UI displayed "11:00" and "12:00".
"10:00" was NOT displayed.

Conclusion:
The application correctly uses `trips.time` as the single source of truth.
No fallback to `options.times` was observed.
Contract is respected.
