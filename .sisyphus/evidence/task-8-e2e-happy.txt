Task 8 validation status: USER-WAIVED FULL E2E
Timestamp: 2026-02-10 (Asia/Bangkok)

Reason:
- User requested to skip full E2E because execution is too slow.

Executed smoke validation instead:
1) Command: npm run build
2) Result: PASS (Next.js build completed successfully)
3) Build output confirms key routes generated, including:
   - /
   - /destinations
   - /destinations/[slug]
   - /cart
   - /my-bookings
   - /bookings
   - /payments

Risk note:
- Full cross-flow E2E (admin -> frontend -> booking persistence -> DB consistency)
  is NOT executed in this run.
- If regressions appear in runtime integrations, run full Task 8 scenarios later.
